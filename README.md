## Practical 

A software engineer working for the government has thrown together a simple console application for Boris & friends to sign up to this years Christmas party. Unfortunately this employee is off sick and having to self-isolate after getting a bit too close and personal with Matt Nobcock. 

Here are the requirements:

- As a party organiser I want users to be able to submit their name and email-address to register for the Christmas party.
- As a party organiser I only want users of 18 years and over to be able to register.

The first requirement has been completed but the application cannot go live without the second requirement. 

Hints:

- Age validation logic needs adding.
- The age validation should be in a new class and should be unit tested.
